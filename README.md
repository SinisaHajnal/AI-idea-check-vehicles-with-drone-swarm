# Elements-of-AI-idea
Creating an idea project for Elements of AI - check vehicles for outside damage via drone swarm

## Summary
Airplanes in airports, ships at busy ports, military submarines...all those vehicles need to be fairly undamaged to function optimally. Especially important for airplanes. Instead of having people visually inspect the vehicle exterior while doing other maintenance work or refueling, send drone swarm to scan the vehicle from all sides using more than visual scan (infrared, ultraviolet and sonar should be fairly easy to put on even small drone).

Have AI receive all those images and compile 'critical issues/areas' for humans to review - or send those to more advanced/specialized AI.


## Background
Which problems does your idea solve? 
* free humans for more hands-on maintenance
* use faster and better (more senses) scan than humans use
* prevent in-travel trouble by recognizing stress points before they actually fail
* prevent vehicle loss (especially in air travel!!) by replacing marked parts in time

How common or frequent is this problem? 
Just a guess, but I'd say very frequent as all vehicles need occasional check-ups and with millions in traffic at any time...

What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
No personal motivation...although it would be interesting to see automobile checked by such swarm - maybe for insurance or yearly registration check.

## How is it used?
When the vehicles parks in the port, drone swarm...well...swarms out and checks the target. AI compiles images into proper 3D model with marked stress areas.

## Data sources and AI methods
The source would be drone cameras/other sensors, AI methods: image classification via deep learning, trained on existing images of vehicles in ports.


## Challenges
The challenge would be to convince humans to release high-risk vehicle (such as an airplane) based only on AI recommendation. Who would be responsible if that airplace fails? ship/submarine sinks?

## What next?
Next part could be automated cleaning/repair - cleaning for ships, especially under water-line where barnacles can cause slowing down, increase fuel consumption and do damage.
